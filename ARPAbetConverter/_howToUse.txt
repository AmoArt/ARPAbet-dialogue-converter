How to use this python script.

First you need a text with list of ARPAbet words:

DEGER   D IY1 G ER0
DEGIACOMO   D IY1 JH AH0 K OW0 M OW0
DEGIDIO   D IH0 JH IY1 D IY0 OW0
DEGIROLAMO   D IH0 JH IH0 R OW0 L AA1 M OW0

and so on, you can download the entire dictionary lexicon from "The CMU Pronouncing Dictionary", for custom words 
(like names from fantasy or scifi tv shows) you will need to create a seperate text file and write them in in same way its written above.
Place those files in folder 'dictionares'. It would be recommended to keep those seperated for futureproofing editing.
(PS do not use microsoft Notepad as it adds \ufffd characters when saving txt files)


###
Second you need to have prepared seperate text file with list of all your files attached to correct writting (missing/misspelling files will cause errors)
The following format should look something like this:
audio.wav|dialogue;

For example after runing script on file containing this:

audiofile0001.wav|Hello.;
wavs/00_04_02__What can we do.wav|What can we do?!;


we will get this:

audiofile0001.wav|{HH AH0 L OW1}.;
wavs/00_04_02__What can we do.wav|{W AH1 T} {K AE1 N} {W IY1} {D UW1}?!;


###
Run 
_ARPAbet dictionary PART A _fin.py

This will combine all the files in folder 'dictionares'


###
Run 
_ARPAbet dictionary PART B _fin.py

This script will create python dictionary out of the 'raw_ARPAbet.txt' and apply to the dialogue file.
To check if all the words were converted open the 'OUTPUT_ARPAbet.txt' in Notepad++ and use Regex code 
(\{).*?(\}) to remove all the arpabet words, any words that were left out need to be added to 
custom text file in  'dictionares' folder, than converted to proper arpabet pronunciation.
