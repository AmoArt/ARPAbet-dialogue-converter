    4 python files.

copy and paste the Gothic 2 dialogue .d file inside this folder, than run the scripts, from 1, 2 than 3.
use the files "audiofiles_" with the script "__duplicateFiles" to copy the wav files from a folder A to a folder B.

    _dialogue_1_seperator_005a.py
strips the entire script from non-dialogue lines to the "output_" text file, as well as form at it for better future audio training 
(it may require further text file edition to get format working with whatever file processing you wish to use) example here:

DIA_DiegoOw_Hallo_11_00.wav|Hey, I thought you were dead.
DIA_DiegoOw_Hallo_15_01.wav|Yes ... so I was.

    _dialogue_2_divider_002a.py
takes the above files, and split them between the dialogue lines of Player Character and the NPC:

output2_DIA_PC_ThiefOW_div_PC:
DIA_DiegoOw_Hallo_11_00.wav|Hey, I thought you were dead.

audiofiles_PC_ThiefOW_div_PC.txt:
DIA_DiegoOw_Hallo_15_01.wav|Yes ... so I was.

    _dialogue_3_audios_001b.py
takes the above files, and removes all the elements not referencing the .wav file, so it can be easier used with the __duplicateFiles.py code
